You are an experienced frontend developer and security-aware designer.

Build a minimal, offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA) called “One-Year Vault”.

This app is a private digital vault for personal writing. It must be simple, elegant, distraction-free, and fully local.

📌 Product Concept

The app allows a user to freely write thoughts, reflections, memories, lessons, or anything they want.

There is no forced structure.

The writing space should feel calm and private.

The vault remains editable until New Year’s Day.

On New Year’s Day (or via a manual trigger), the vault locks permanently.

After locking, the content becomes encrypted and unreadable inside the app.

The encrypted data can be downloaded as a backup file.

The vault can only be decrypted later using a predefined passkey (not generated by the app).

🧭 App States (Very Important)
1. OPEN STATE

Free-form writing

Editable anytime

Soft placeholder hints (not labels), such as:

“Anything you want to remember…”

“Things that changed you…”

“A letter you don’t want to read yet…”

Content stored locally

2. LOCKED STATE

Triggered automatically on New Year’s Day OR manually

Editing disabled

Plaintext wiped from storage

Content encrypted using the predefined passkey

App UI shows:

“Vault Locked”

A calm message saying it opens next Christmas

Optional minimal countdown to next Christmas

Only actions allowed:

Download encrypted vault file

View locked screen

The app itself must not be able to decrypt or display content after lock.

🔐 Encryption Requirements

Use Web Crypto API

Use AES-GCM

Derive encryption key from a predefined passphrase using PBKDF2

Store salt and metadata with encrypted data

Do NOT store the passphrase in plaintext anywhere

💾 Storage Requirements

Use IndexedDB for all app data

Before lock:

Store plaintext writing

After lock:

Plaintext must be deleted

Only encrypted data remains

No cloud

No backend

No accounts

No analytics

📥 File Export

Allow downloading the encrypted vault as a file (e.g. .vault or .enc)

File must remain unreadable without the passkey

File can be downloaded multiple times after lock

🎨 UI / UX Guidelines

Minimal

Elegant

Neutral color palette

Clean typography

No emojis (except optional 🎄 on locked screen)

No gamification

No notifications

No animations except subtle transitions

This should feel introspective, not playful.

🚫 Explicit Constraints (Do NOT Do These)

Do NOT use any backend or server

Do NOT use cloud storage

Do NOT auto-send keys or messages

Do NOT generate encryption keys dynamically

Do NOT require login or signup

Do NOT over-structure the writing experience

📦 Expected Output

A working PWA

Installable on mobile/desktop

Fully offline

Clear separation between open and locked states

Clean, readable code
